Course description from Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/info

This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”. This course is equivalent to the first half of the 11-week "Programming for Everybody (Python)" course. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 2.
